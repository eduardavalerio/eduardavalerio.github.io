I'm an undergraduate student in Oceanography at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo (IOUSP). I had three years of experience in cientific iniciation working with environmental DNA (eDNA), DNA barcoding and metabarcoding, molecular ecology and bioinformatics with fully funded project by São Paulo Research Foudation (FAPESP), entitled "Multilocus DNA barcode of marine species not represented in sequences database: subsidies for DNA metabarcoding of the São Paulo coast". Also, I had international experience in University of Salford, UK, where I did a research internship abroad, envolving eDNA and DNA metabarcoding approaches fully funded by FAPESP as well.

This year I started a new project in physical oceanography, analysing phytoplankton transportation in Brazil-Falckland confluence and relating with satellite data.
